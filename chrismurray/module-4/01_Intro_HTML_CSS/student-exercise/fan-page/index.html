                <h2>Octopus Tradition</h2>
                <p>
                    The <q>Legend of the Octopus</q> is a sporting tradition during playoff games, where fans throw octopus onto the ice for good luck. 
                    This tradition started in 1952 when Peter Cusimano, local fish market owner, threw one from the stands onto the ice. 
                    The eight tentacles on the octopus was meant to symbolize the eight wins it took to win the Stanley Cup Championship. 
                    The Red Wings went on to win the cup that year and it has been a good luck charm ever since. It has been banned by the NHL, 
                    but the tradition lives on.
